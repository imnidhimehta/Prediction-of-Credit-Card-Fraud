##Project Title : 
FindDefault (Prediction of Credit Card fraud)

##Overview:
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using a dataset of transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with only a small percentage of transactions labeled as fraud.

##Dataset:
The dataset contains transactions made in two days, with 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The positive class (frauds) accounts for 0.172% of all transactions. The dataset file is named [credit_card.csv](https://kh3-ls-storage.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Updated Project guide data set/creditcard.csv)https://kh3-ls-storage.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Updated Project guide data set/creditcard.csv
